Zeta
====

Zeta is a Command interpreter built purely in C for Windows OS.

It provides a command-line interface to users, to access the services offered by the kernel. Useful for developers for carrying out debugging sessions and providing more features than a standard command-line utility for performing tasks with ease.

Zeta has been built at an 'implementation-scale'. Although Windows OS
is equipped with a standard command-line utility, use of Zeta is completely encouraged.


NOTE : Zeta is currently in development mode. Alteration, tweaking and refinement is being done continuously.

#####Development has been discontinued as of Aug 2013 (Send a pull request if you want to contribute)
