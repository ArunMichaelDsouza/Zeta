Zeta
====

Zeta is a Command interpreter built purely in C for Windows OS.
It provides a command- line interface to access common services for calculation and manipulation of data.

Zeta has been built at an 'implementation-scale'. Apart from the standard Windows OS command-line utility (CMD), Zeta can also be used.
