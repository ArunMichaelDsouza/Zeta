Zeta
====

Zeta is a prompt/command interpreter built purely in C for Windows OS.

Coding by - Arun Michael Dsouza 

Date : 26/09/2013

It provides a command-line interface to users, to access the services offered by the kernel of the OS.

Zeta has been built at an 'implementation-scale'. Although the native OS
is equipped with a standard command-line utility, use of Zeta is completely encouraged.


NOTE : Zeta is currently in development mode. Alteration, tweaking and refinement of code will be done during the release of the first build.
